How to use:

-Please run the program from the 'Main' class. You will then be prompted to enter your inputs
on the command line. 

-The program will check if the inputs are in a valid format and prompt you to enter your inputs again if they are found to be invalid. 

-The results will be printed to the command line at the end of the program.

Design:

-The 3 classes used in this assignment are Rover, Plateau and Position. 

-A position is a simple x and y coordinate pair to describe a position on the plateau. 

-The rover object contains a position (x and y coordinate) on the plateau, a cardinal direction to indicate where it is facing and a move sequence made up of R,L & M that describes the moves the rover will make

-The plateau object is set up as a simple grid of x and y coordinates. The plateau keeps track of the positions currently occupied by rovers to ensure they do not crash into one another or go out of bounds.

Assumptions:

-Only one rover can occupy a postion at a time (i.e two rovers cannot share the same position)

-If a rover is about to collide into another rover it will stop at its current position and terminate

-Rovers cannot go out of bounds (i.e cannot exceed the plateaus size)

-If a rover is about to go out of bounds it will stop at its current positions and terminate
